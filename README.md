## Simple Quick Start Algolia search solution

Algolia has many search solution options available. For the purpose of this project, I will go through the simple node based solution to quickly integrate Algolia search capabilities for delivering real-time results in milliseconds. Iâ€™ll be using the eCommerce sample data to showcase how to: 
- Upload the data using the REST API
- Create indexes to improve relevance search
- Finally integrate with your site and display the search.

### Upload the data
There are multiple ways to upload data to Algolia for performing relevance search 1) using the dashboard 2) using the REST API. For a quick start project, I am using the REST API. As you can see, this takes only a few lines of code to automate the upload processing using the REST API. To upload the data, type [node upload-data.js](https://github.com/amitp007/algolia-ecommerce-indexing-app/blob/master/upload-data.js).

### Create indexes to improve relevance search
Once the data is uploaded, the next step would be to create the indexes. Again, this can be done two ways 1) using the dashboard 2) using the API.  In this sample application, I have decided to use REST API to create indexes. The settings can be tweaked to fine tune the search behavior.  This process is also fairly simple and can be done with a few lines of code, as shown in the file. To create indexes, type [npm create-index.js](https://github.com/amitp007/algolia-ecommerce-indexing-app/blob/master/create-index.js)

### Integrate with front-end 
The last steps are to tie everything together to display the search result. The integration with front-end requires minimal setups, as can be seen with the solution here. The instantsearch.js is composed of many UI widgets, and I am using some of those widgets to build the best search experience of the users.  Additional information on the instantsearcht can be found here. Steps to start the applciation are provided below

As you can experience with very little effort, a solution can be created for the end-user to perform the cell phone search by category, brands, price, and full text search. 

FEEDBACK:
For advance use, what would be great is to provide users with the ability to target certain attributes for searching with some sort of advance query.
